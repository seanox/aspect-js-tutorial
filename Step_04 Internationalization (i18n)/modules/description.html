  Seanox aspect-js supports a internationalization.<br>
  The internationalization (i18n) is based on a resource bundle that is based on
  the XML file ./data/locales.xml. This file contains the corresponding key value
  entries for all supported languages. The language is automatically determined
  by the language support of the browser or can be set explicitly using the DataSource
  on which the resource bundle is based. In addition, a default language can be
  set in the XML file locales.xml if an unsupported language is requested.

  With the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, this usually happens later.
  But the earlier you start, the less work you will have later and it's very easy
  in Seanox aspect-js.
