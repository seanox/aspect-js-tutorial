  Seanox aspect-js supports a internationalization.<br>
  The internationalization (i18n) is based on a resource bundle that is based on the XML file ./data/locales.xml.
  This file contains the corresponding key value entries for all supported languages.
  The language is automatically determined by the language support of the browser
  or can be set explicitly using the DataSource on which the resource bundle is based.
  In addition, a default language can be set in the XML file locales.xml if an unsupported language is requested.

  With the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, this usually happens later.
  But the earlier you start, the less work you will have later and it's very easy in Seanox aspect-js.
