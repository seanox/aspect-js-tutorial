# Description
The tutorial guides you through the creation of a SPA (Single-Page-Application)
with [Seanox aspect-js](https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js).   
Using a small example, the implementation is explained step by step from the
prototype to the finished application.

The tutorial is based on understanding and visualizing the differences of the
the serveral steps and therefore requires a program for comparison.

After downloading and unpacking, all steps can be called as independent
applications via a web server.  
The changes in each step are documented and provided with references to the user
manual.  
This information becomes visible when the steps are compared.  
In addition, there are ToDo' s with small instructions and tips to try for
yourself.
