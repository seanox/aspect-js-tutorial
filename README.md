# Description
The tutorial guides you through the creation of a SPA (Single-Page-Application)
with [Seanox aspect-js](https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js). Small examples are
used to explain the implementation step by step from prototype to finished
application.

The tutorial is based on understanding through visualization of the differences
between the steps and therefore requires a program for comparison.

After downloading and unpacking, all steps can be called as independent
applications via a web server. The changes in each step are documented and
provided with references to the user manual. This information becomes visible
when the steps are compared.
