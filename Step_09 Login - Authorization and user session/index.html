      CSS trick for suppressing non-rendered elements.
      This is helpful, for example, to prevent the expression syntax from being displayed.
      If the renderer has completed an element, it removes the attribute and the element becomes visible.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/markup.md#release

      The style would fit well in common.css, but the file is not loaded by the renderer until the page is loaded by the browser.
      In the meantime, for example, the expression syntax is visible.
      Therefore the decision to store the style here.

      Integration von Seanox aspect-js
      Seanox aspect-js is pure JavaScript and consists of a file.
      The library can be downloaded and integrated standalone or a release channel can be used.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/introduction.md#getting-started

          404 Resource Not Found is shown in the console:      
      http://127.0.0.1/.../data/locales.xml
      aspect-js supports a NoSQL data source and a resource bundle for internationalization.
      During the start, the framework searches for appropriate data.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 04.
      
          404 Resource Not Found is shown in the console:      
      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.css
      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.js
      aspect-js supports a module concept.
      Because the framework can not know the structure of the modules, it is helpful in some cases,
      if already when initializing the application general is done, there is the module "common",
      which is searched automatically with the program start.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 03.

      aspect-js supports a module concept where the modules are called composites.
      Composites are declared with an ID and the attribute composite.
      Composites can consist of markup (HTML), CSS and JavaScript.
      All these components are optional and can be moved to the module directory.
      The renderer automatically searches for corresponding components in the module directory.
      Markup is only searched for if the composite has no inner HTML.
          see also: https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/composite.md#components     

          attribute static:
      The visibility of the composites is controlled by the SiteMap.
      This will be explained later.
      The static attribute specifies that a composite is always visible.
      This will be changed later.

        The internationalization (i18n) is based on a resource bundle that is based on the XML file ./data/locales.xml.
        This file contains the corresponding key value entries for all supported languages.
        The language is automatically determined by the language support of the browser
        or can be set explicitly using the DataSource on which the resource bundle is based.
        In addition, a default language can be set in the XML file locales.xml if an unsupported language is requested.
            see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/messages.md#resource-bundle-messages
            
        In this example, the language setting is used by the browser.    
        
        The expression language of Seanox aspect-js is used for the output of the texts.
            see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/expression.md#expression-language
        This has full JavaScript support and provides the additional object Messages for the resource bundle.
