      Integration of Seanox aspect-js
      Seanox aspect-js is pure JavaScript and consists of a file.
      The library can be downloaded and integrated standalone or a release channel can be used.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/introduction.md#getting-started

          404 Resource Not Found is shown in the console:      
      http://127.0.0.1/.../data/locales.xml
      aspect-js supports a NoSQL data source and a resource bundle for internationalization.
      During the start, the framework searches for appropriate data.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 04.

      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.css
      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.js
      aspect-js supports a module concept.
      Because the framework can not know the structure of the modules, it is helpful in some cases,
      if already when initializing the application general is done, there is the module "common",
      which is searched automatically with the program start.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 03.

      As the test environment also manipulates the JavaScript API, it is not

      aspect-js supports a module concept where the modules are called composites.
      Composites are declared with an ID and the attribute composite.
      Composites can consist of markup (HTML), CSS and JavaScript.
      All these components are optional and can be moved to the module directory.
      The renderer automatically searches for corresponding components in the module directory.
      Markup is only searched for if the composite has no inner HTML.
          see also: https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/composite.md#components

          attribute release
      The optional attribute does not display the elements until they have been rendered.
      Among other things, this prevents the Expression Language from being displayed before it has been processed.



      The internationalization (i18n) is based on a resource bundle that is based on the XML file ./data/locales.xml.
      This file contains the corresponding key value entries for all supported languages.
      The language is automatically determined by the language support of the browser
      or can be set explicitly using the DataSource on which the resource bundle is based.
      In addition, a default language can be set in the XML file locales.xml if an unsupported language is requested.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/message.md#resource-bundle-messages

      In this example, the language setting is used by the browser.
      In the next step we build the first module to change the language via the menu.
      
      The expression language of Seanox aspect-js is used for the output of the texts.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/expression.md#expression-language
      This has full JavaScript support and provides the additional object Messages for the resource bundle.



      Using the DataSource is only one of many ways to use dynamic data.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/datasource.md#datasource
      However, the DataSource is more of an example for semi-dynamic data because it is based on static data in the web space.

    <!--
      By combining the attributes 'composite' and 'route', the composites become
      views. This creates the paths (routes), which result from the nesting of
      the composites in the markup and the resulting combination of IDs.

      In this example, the following paths result:
      - #         -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#
      - #home     -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#home
      - #projects -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#projects
      - #project  -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#project
      - #about    -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#about
      - #person   -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#person
      - #contact  -> http://127.0.0.1/.../#contact

      The control of visibility, or more precisely its presence in the DOM, is
      then taken over by the routing and depends on the path (route) and the
      implemented permission concept.

      Composites without the attribute 'route' are not controlled by routing and
      are therefore visible if the parent element is visible.

        Example for the projection of data by XSL Transformation.
        The transformation takes over the file portfolio.xslt, the data source is portfolio.

        The data and templates are stored separately for each language.
        However, the language is not specified during access, the framework and the browser take care of this.
        
        A separate HTML file is not required.
        Module files for JavaScript and CSS can be used.
        The Expression Language can also be used in the XSL template.
        The expressions are then executed after the final XSL transformation.
