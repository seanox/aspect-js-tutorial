  Example for using dynamic data with the DataSource and Expression Language It
  does not matter where the data comes from. It can also be a REST API.
  It should demonstrate the use of the Expression Language in combination with
  JavaScript and the markup functions.
  Particularly the use of temporary variables is interesting.

  Normally, the logic is moved to the JavaScript model and can use additional
  data access layers there.

        Resources with expressions in the src attribute are loaded immediately
        by the browser, which usually leads to an error output in the browser
        console by the server status 404. It is similar with read-only
        attributes in HTML elements (readonly, checked, disabled, ...). In these
        cases @-attributes can be used. These are interpreted by the renderer as
        attribute templates, from which the final attribute is created only
        during rendering. This prevents the browser from misinterpreting the
        expression in the attributes.
