      Integration von Seanox aspect-js
      Seanox aspect-js is pure JavaScript and consists of a file.
      The library can be downloaded and integrated standalone or a release channel can be used.
          see also https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/introduction.md#getting-started

          404 Resource Not Found is shown in the console:      
      http://127.0.0.1/.../data/locales.xml
      aspect-js supports a NoSQL data source and a resource bundle for internationalization.
      During the start, the framework searches for appropriate data.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 04.
      
          404 Resource Not Found is shown in the console:      
      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.css
      http://127.0.0.1/.../modules/common.js
      aspect-js supports a module concept.
      Because the framework can not know the structure of the modules, it is helpful in some cases,
      if already when initializing the application general is done, there is the module "common",
      which is searched automatically with the program start.
      If these are missing, this is okay.
      The explanation will follow a later in step 03.

      aspect-js supports a module concept where the modules are called composites.
      Composites are declared with an ID and the attribute composite.
      Composites can consist of markup (HTML), CSS and JavaScript.
      All these components are optional and can be moved to the module directory.
      The renderer automatically searches for corresponding components in the module directory.
      Markup is only searched for if the composite has no inner HTML.
          see also: https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/blob/master/manual/en/composite.md#components     

          attribute static:
      The visibility of the composites is controlled by the SiteMap.
      This will be explained later.
      The static attribute specifies that a composite is always visible.
      This will be changed later.
