  Seanox aspect-js supports a module concept where the modules are called composites.
  Composites are declared with an ID and the attribute composite.
  Composites can consist of markup (HTML), CSS and JavaScript.
  All these components are optional and can be moved to the module directory.
  The renderer automatically searches for corresponding components in the module directory.

  The presentation does not change.<br>
  But in the background the application becomes more modular and clearer.
