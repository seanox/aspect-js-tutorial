  Example for using dynamic data with the DataSource and Expression Language It
  does not matter where the data comes from. It can also be a REST API.
  It should demonstrate the use of the Expression Language in combination with
  JavaScript and the markup functions.
  Particularly the use of temporary variables is interesting.

  Normally, the logic is moved to the JavaScript model and can use additional
  data access layers there.

        Resources with expressions in the src-attribute are initially loaded by the browser.
        A 404 error will always occur in the browser console.
        As one solution among many, the x-src attribute and a corresponding custom
        selector are used to compute the final value and only then set the src attribute.

        A constructed example.
        This function is more useful if you want to call a function by link and
        you want to reach this function by tabulator, e.g. to open a
        dialog/popup. 
        
        The benefit is that the link is actually accessible and yet has no
        direct influence on the presentation and page position.
        The link can be clicked, but URL/hash and page-position are apparently
        unchanged.
